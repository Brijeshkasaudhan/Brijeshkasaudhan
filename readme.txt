I’m a passionate Software & AI Developer currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science (CGPA: 8.09), with hands-on experience in building real-world applications using JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, and Java. I love solving problems and turning ideas into working products — from creating a Smart Parking Management System with Razorpay integration to designing a CNN-based Plant Disease Detection model achieving 90% accuracy.

I’ve completed multiple industry-recognized internships under AICTE, Microsoft, Edunet, and Salesforce, where I worked on AI foundations, data analytics, predictive modeling, and cloud-based automation. My work spans full-stack development, machine learning, UI/UX design, and backend logic.

My GitHub reflects my commitment to continuous learning, clean coding practices, and building impactful projects that address real-world challenges. I’m actively looking for opportunities to apply my technical expertise in AI, full-stack development, or software engineering roles.
